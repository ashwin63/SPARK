<td width="50% colspan="2" rowspan="2"><font size="5" color="#000">Spark Hospitals gives some tips for helth for a balanced diet.All in all, it is time for change. Healthy women are the pillars of both their families and of society. Not only should they be informed how to stay healthy, but also that it is their right to do so; healthcare must be accessible to them. Medical supervision both before and during their pregnancy is crucial. Cordaid works on improving this for all women.The time has come to make healthcare accessible to all people regardless of whether they live in rich or poor areas. The approach used tightens controls and enables patients to take part in deciding their own treatment. In addition, staff remuneration has been made dependent on the achieved results in order to motivate staff to go the extra mile. An approach is called for that not only limits patient contribution to healthcare but also improves its accessibilityIn June 2015 during the MA4 Health Summit in Washington the roadmap for Health measurement and accountability was adopted.
Now, clinical specialists can make their services more accessible across the healthcare ecosystem, to broader audiences & cost effectively reach more patients virtually anytime, anywhere. Additionally, physicians can now monitor patient’s health more closely & frequently to achieve better clinical outcome which reduces the gap between patient and Care Giver in effective manner. </td>
